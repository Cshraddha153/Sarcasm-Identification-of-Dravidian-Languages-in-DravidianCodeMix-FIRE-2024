----->>  Sarcasm Identification of Dravidian Languages in DravidianCodeMix@FIRE-2024  <<---------

--------------------------->> Organized by DravidianLangTech <<----------------------------------

Sarcasm is regarded as one of the most challenging challenges for sentiment analysis systems. 
It indirectly communicates an opinion, with the intended meaning diverging from the literal one.
There is an increasing demand for sarcasm and sentiment detection on social media texts which are
largely code-mixed for Dravidian languages. Code-mixing is a prevalent phenomenon in a multilingual 
community and the code-mixed texts are sometimes written in non-native scripts. Systems trained on
monolingual data fail on code-mixed data due to the complexity of code-switching at different linguistic
levels in the text. This shared task presents a new gold standard corpus for sarcasm and sentiment detection
of code-mixed text in Dravidian languages (Tamil-English and Malayalam-English).


The  Tamil language is spoken by Tamil people in India, Sri Lanka, and by the Tamil diaspora around the world,
with official recognition in India, Sri Lanka, and Singapore. Malayalam is a Dravidian language spoken predominantly
by the people of Kerala, India. The Tamil script evolved from the Tamili script, Vatteluttu alphabet, and Chola-Pallava script.
It has 12 vowels, 18 consonants, and 1 āytam (voiceless velar fricative). Minority languages such as Saurashtra,
Badaga, Irula, and Paniya are also written in the Tamil script. Malayalam scripts are alpha-syllabic, belonging to a family
of abugida writing systems that is partially alphabetic and partially syllable-based. However, social media users often mix Roman
script for typing because it is easy to input. Hence, the majority of the data available in social media for these under-resourced 
languages are code-mixed. 


The goal of this task is to identify sarcasm and sentiment polarity of the code-mixed dataset of comments/posts in Tamil-English
and Malayalam-English collected from social media.
